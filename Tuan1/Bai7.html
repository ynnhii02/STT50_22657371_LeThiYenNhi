    <h1> Body Systems LSM400 Linear Smith Machine </h1>
    <h2> Overview </h2>
    <p>
        Linear Smith Machines are the ultimate in weight machines and the LSM400 leads the field. Designed for both serious fitness users and beginners, the
        <br>LSM400's vertical design provides all of the safety and control associated>with Smith Machines, while still allowing for the effective use of gravity
        <br>for effective resistance. You don't even need a workout partner. Lock points can be set to prevent the bar from movement outside of your body's natural
        <br>range of motion.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can tailor the LSM400 to meet you specific workout needs. Start with the basic package of the Smith Machine rack and, as your needs grow, add a
        <br>lat/row, pec dec, plate tree, dip, and accessory organizer. Accessories are easyto insert and remove, allowing you to continue your workout
        <br>without delay.The LSM400 works with all standard Olympic weight plates.
    </p>
    <p>
        The LSM400 is compact with all components place one side of the unit for easy access. This makes the LSM400 perfect for people who want a quality
        <br>home gym, but do not have a lot of space. Place the LSM400 against a wall and you're ready to go!

        <b> Smooth Smith Action: </b> The bar (rated at 800 lb. capacity) slides on Teflon bushings alongside solid steel guide rods. Smooth motion is key to successful
        <br>workouts, as the target muscles are utilized to their full potential with each repetition.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Proper Angle: </b> The bar travels along a 7 degree path from vertical. Studies have shown that this is the proper lifting angle to increase your comfort and
        <br>prevent injury.
    </p>
    <p>
