    <h1> Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) </h1>
    <br>
        The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, Leonhard Euler was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant 
        <br> of mathematics, Jean Bernoulli. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler
        <br> was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over 800 different books and papers. His influence was felt in physics and 
        <br> astronomy as well. Euler's work on mathematical analysis, Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748) remained a standard textbook for well 
        <br> over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote Lettres a une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772), giving a clear non-technical 
        <br> outline of the main physical theories of the time. </br>
    </p>
        One can hardly do math without copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such as e and pi, were introduced in Euler's writings. He is perhaps 
        <br> best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's formula </br>
    </p>
    <p> cos(x) + isin(x) = e (ix) </p>
    <p> demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive the equation </p>
    <P> e(pi i) + 1 = 0 </P>
    <p> which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, pi, e, and i in a single beautiful and elegant statement. </p>
    <p> Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics. </p>

    <p> 4 stars I loved the buttery taste of the crust which complements the apples very nicely. -- Reviewed on Sep. 22, 2010 by MMASON. </p>

    <p> Nothing special. I like the crust, but there was a little too much of it for my taste, and I liked the filling but there was too little of it. I thought the crunchy apples combined with the sliced almonds detracted from the overall flavor. -- Reviewed on Sep. 1, 2010 by GLENDACHEF. </p>

    Delicious!! I recommend microwaving the apples for 3 minutes before baking, to soften them. Great dessert - I'll be making it again for the holidays. -- Reviewed on August 28, 2010 by BBABS.
